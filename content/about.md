You might know me as the creator & maintainer of [eDEX-UI](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui), an open-source terminal emulator and system monitor for desktops, or as the webmaster / sysadmin at [&lt;codebrew/&gt;](https://codebrew.fr). I mess around with computers & code as a hobby and might make it a job someday.
In the meantime, I study industrial conception & design near Paris, France.

I also make tiny bits of music with my guitar sometimes, but that's probably not what you're here for.
