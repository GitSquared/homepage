      <description>tl;dr: Desktop software signing is like SSL used to be not so long ago: both extremely interesting for end-users and developers alike, but too expensive for anyone not running a business.
Earlier today, I was looking at the issues left on eDEX-UI, and decided to work on #278 - &amp;ldquo;Implementing an internal self-update mechanism&amp;rdquo;.
After a bit of thinking and research, I ended up dropping the idea, even though it would in theory be easy to implement: there is the nice, built-in Electron autoUpdate API, but I&amp;rsquo;d need to code-sign the releases first, and while there is also the electron-builder way that does not require signing, I just don&amp;rsquo;t feel that the added security risks are worth it.</description>
