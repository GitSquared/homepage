    <h2>Hey! Almost forgot to introduce myself.</h2>
	<p>I'm a young man living near Paris (France's capital, not the one in Texas). I'm currently doing my last year in high school, and I plan to study for a digital marketing and computer science degree next.</p>
	<br/><p>My hobbies include sailing, snowboard and playing guitar, plus video games sometimes - my favorites are Portal 2, EVE Online, and Payday 2.</p>
	<p>Movies are great, too! I'm a Mad Max fan, and some of my all-time favs are Apocalypse Now, Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction. Watch them if you didn't already, you won't regret it. I wasn't paid to say this.</p>
	<p>While we're here, we might as well talk about music, uh? I listen to anything from blues to soft metal, and sometimes electronic/dubstep.</p>
	<br/><br/><p>If you want to know more or chat, you can reach me with the links either at the top of this page (if you're on a smartphone/tablet) or to your left. I'm always willing to have a friendly discussion!</p>
