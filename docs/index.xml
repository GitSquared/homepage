      <description>tl;dr: Desktop software signing is like SSL used to be not so long ago: both extremely interesting for end-users and developers alike, but too expensive for anyone not running a business.
Earlier today, I was looking at the issues left on eDEX-UI, and decided to take a look at #278 - &amp;ldquo;Implementing an internal self-update mechanism&amp;rdquo;.
After a bit of thinking and research, I decided to drop the idea, even though it would in theory be easy to implement: there is the nice, built-in Electron autoUpdate API, but I&amp;rsquo;d need to code-sign the releases first, and while there is also the electron-builder way that does not require signing, I just don&amp;rsquo;t feel that the added security risks are worth it.</description>

      <description>You might know me as the creator &amp;amp; maintainer of eDEX-UI, an open-source terminal emulator and system monitor for desktops, or as the webmaster / sysadmin at &amp;lt;codebrew/&amp;gt;. I mess around with computers &amp;amp; code as a hobby and might make it a job someday. In the meantime, I study industrial conception &amp;amp; design near Paris, France.
I also make tiny bits of music with my guitar sometimes, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably not what you&amp;rsquo;re here for.</description>
