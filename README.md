# homepage
Homepage of https://square.codebrew.fr/, showing off my work and hosting some stuff.

Made using HTML5, CSS3, and a bit of vanilla javascript. Compatible with smartphone/small screens thanks to CSS media queries. Compatible with any recent browser (including Edge), and MAY work in some old IEs if they got proper transform and flexbox support.

Feel free to play around with the design, but please don't copy the logo or text content.
