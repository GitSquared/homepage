      <description>To help with a little investigation of mine regarding international languages support in eDEX-UI, I wanted to analyze a font file to see how many alphabets and languages it could support.
After a bit of ducking around, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find an online tool that did this properly, so I built my own: Mr. Worldwide.
Mr.Worldwide analyzes the writing systems supported by a font (support of specific unicode ranges corresponding to regional languages) and displays the results in a way that is easy to understand at a glance - a colored world map.</description>

      <title>Code Signing &amp; why it (currently) sucks</title>

      <description>tl;dr: Desktop software signing is like SSL used to be not so long ago: both extremely interesting for end-users and developers alike, but too expensive for anyone not running a business.
Earlier today, I was looking at the issues left on eDEX-UI, and decided to work on #278 - &amp;ldquo;Implementing an internal self-update mechanism&amp;rdquo;.
After a bit of thinking and research, I ended up dropping the idea, even though it would in theory be easy to implement: there is the nice, built-in Electron autoUpdate API, but I&amp;rsquo;d need to code-sign the releases first, and while there is also the electron-builder way that does not require signing, I just don&amp;rsquo;t feel that the added security risks are worth it.</description>
